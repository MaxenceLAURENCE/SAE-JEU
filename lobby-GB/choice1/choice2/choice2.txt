WHOOSH … WHOOSH… WHOOSH…

Just before the wild beast tore you to pieces, you managed to pull out your katana and slit its throat several times, you can be proud of yourself.

You managed to get away with a few scratches, but you're safe and sound!

You continue your advance towards the forest, this time it’s a dazzling light that attracts your attention. 

You move closer to see what it is... You move forward and forward...
You can't believe your eyes...
These are... These are…

THESE ARE SEED BALLS !!!!!

What a feat !!!!

These seeds are the only way to feed on this planet apart from hunting. 
As a biologist, it's your duty to know where to plant them. You go back to the shuttle and think. 

Where can you plant them? You have several choices:


Choice 1 : Near your ship 

Choice 2 : On the plains in the centre of the forest

Choice 3 : Or perhaps you'd prefer to plant them later?
