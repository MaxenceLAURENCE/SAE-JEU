Heading for the forest plains! 
You grab your farming equipment and head for the forest plains you spotted earlier. 

Happy to have found the seed balls, you walk at an energetic pace and forget to check your surroundings...

You finally reach the plains, but you didnâ€™t even had time to set down your equipment when... 

The ground starts to slide... You panick and wonder what's going on, the plains were nothing more than quicksand !!!! 

You get swallowed up and die... Taking the rest of humanity with you :,(
