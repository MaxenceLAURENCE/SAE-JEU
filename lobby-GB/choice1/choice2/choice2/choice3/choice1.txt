You accept the presence of the Jawas and try to communicate with them. With a few gestures, they offer you valuable tools to improve your equipment. 

The Jawas seem to have a camp nearby, where they grow local plants. 
Living with them, you learn that they have knowledge of the local flora and fauna, which could help you better prepare the planet for humans. 

However, their camp is under attack from predators, and you have to decide whether you want to help them defend their territory or stay behind and let them handle it.


Choice 1: You help the Jawas defend their camp. 

Choice 2: You choose to stand back to protect your own interests.
