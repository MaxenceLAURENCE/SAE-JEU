By choosing to place the bombs, you sneak around Gaïa while she's distracted. Then an idea comes to you : use the panther carcass she's devouring to hide the explosives. 

You approach slowly, taking advantage of the shadows and her inattention. You manage to hide the bombs in the carcass without her noticing you.


Once the explosives are in place, you retreat to a safe distance, holding the detonator in your shaking hands. As Gaïa finishes devouring the carcass, you press the button. 


BOUUUUUUUUMMMMMM !!!


An explosion sounds, tearing through the air and smashing the creature to pieces. Gaïa's final roar resounds throughout the cave before dying out forever.

After a series of ups and downs, you have finally succeeded. The silence that follows is overwhelming. 
You emerge from the cave, exhausted but victorious, and the sky above you is lit up by the arrival of the first Human ships. 

You have accomplished your mission: Amarok is now ready to welcome humans.
