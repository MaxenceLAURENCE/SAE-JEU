Choosing the rocket launcher, you prepare your shot by aiming at Gaïa's massive head. You pull the trigger, and an explosion sounds, injuring badly the creature.

A lot of blood is flowing, but she's not dead. Shelets out a terrifying roar, its massive body straightens, and it charges at you at breathtaking speed.
