Unfortunately for you, karma exists and it's not on your side at all. Having finished attacking the Jawas' camp, the beasts are now attacking yours. 

You find yourself surrounded by dozens of wild beasts, and since you're alone... there's not much you can do except... nothing at all!


You manage as best you can to kill as many beasts as you can, and to look at you, you'd think you were a beast yourself... 

You're at the peak of your game!!! The remaining beasts are running away because you've become so scary. You've won the battle !!!!!


Or almost... You've beaten the beasts but you've fallen victim to the wounds they've given you. You are dead. Perhaps with the help of the Jawas you'd still be alive...
