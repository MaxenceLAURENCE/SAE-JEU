By choosing to plant the seeds close to your ship, you are choosing safety.

You can keep an eye on your plants and protect them in case of any danger.

Nonetheless, the seeds won't plant themselves!!!! 

It's up to you ;) !

To do this, you have plenty of farming equipment in your ship, such as a plough and a seed drill. You start working and terraforming the land then you plant the seeds.  To your great surprise, as soon as they're planted, the plants grow at frightening speed!
Congratulations!

After a hard day, it's time to get some rest. You head for your shuttle and quickly fall asleep.


Zzz…		Zzz…		Zzz…

Zzz…		Zzz…		Zzz…

Zzz…		Zzz…		Zzz…


Your night passes peacefully very peacefully. But it soon turns dramatic when you hear strange noises outside the shuttle. 

Gun in hand, you go outside to see what's going on, only to come face to face with a strange little figure with yellow eyes. 
It is speaking a foreign language, but one that is familiar to you... 

IT’S A JAWA !!!!!

You approach to see what it wants, but you realise that it's not just one of them…

IT'S A HORDE OF JAWAS !!!!

Jawas are harmless little aliens who trade in scrap metal. 
Jawas aren't usually nomadic, they don't move from planet to planet. 
So what are they looking for on Amarok? Perhaps they're there for the same reason as you, and their planet is no longer habitable. 
Would you be ready to live with the Jawas?


Choice 1 : Yes
