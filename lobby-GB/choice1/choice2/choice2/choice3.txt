A landing on an alien planet, a fight with a panther, a walk in the forest - it's been a busy day. 

You decide to get some rest, but first you decide to taste the meat of the local wildlife by eating a piece of the panther that tried to eat you. Isn't it fair that you should taste the one that tried to eat you?

You take a piece of its leg that you cut up, seasoned and grilled earlier.


CRUNCH… CRUNCH… CRUNCH…


The alien meat doesn't even taste that bad, it looks surprisingly good, the green panther leg tastes just like frog legs!

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You savour every last crumb of the thigh!
 
Suddenly, you feel your tiredness rising and your eyelids grow heavy. 
Could it be the meat? Perhaps it contained sleeping toxins. 

You don't have time to think, you rush to bed and fall asleep almost immediately.

Your night passes peacefully very peacefully. But it soon turns dramatic when you hear strange noises outside the shuttle. 

Gun in hand, you go outside to see what's going on, only to come face to face with a strange little figure with yellow eyes. 
It is speaking a foreign language, but one that is familiar to you... 

IT’S A JAWA !!!!!

You approach to see what it wants, but you realise that it's not just one of them…

IT'S A HORDE OF JAWAS !!!!

Jawas are harmless little aliens who trade in scrap metal. 
Jawas aren't usually nomadic, they don't move from planet to planet. 
So what are they looking for on Amarok? Perhaps they're there for the same reason as you, and their planet is no longer habitable. 
Would you be ready to live with the Jawas?


Choice 1 : Yes
