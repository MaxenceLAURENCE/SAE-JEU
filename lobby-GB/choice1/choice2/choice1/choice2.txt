As you flee back to the shuttle, you come across a creature which looks like a giant snake. You manage to shoot it with your futuristic shotgun and your hunting skills, but you realise that your home has been damaged by it. 

You retrieve all your equipment before your shelter turns to dust. 


Your mission starts really really badly... You're low on rations so you decide to build a fire and eat the giant snake. You start to slice off part of its body.

 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


How is this possible? To your surprise, the part of the snake's body that you cut out was its stomach !!!! 
And that's not all !!!!!

THE SEED BALLS ARE INSIDE IT!!!! 

What a lucky coincidence! 
Now all you have to do is plant them. Which you do without a moment.


Unfortunately, the plants don't grow, it looks like they've spent too much time in the snake's acid stomach. 

So you can't complete your mission... You're leading humanity to its doom...
