Ouch... You quickly grab the carcass of the panther you have just killed and head for the cave. 

Unfortunately, you're having trouble pulling the carcass out. The beasts are starting to get dangerously close. You continue to pull the carcass while the beasts get closer and closer. 

You are finally in front of the cave when all the beasts start to flee. You don't understand what's happening but you're happy. 

You enter the cave and it turns out not to be a cave but a mouth, the mouth of a giant earthworm. You're dead... You'll be luckier next time, maybe...
