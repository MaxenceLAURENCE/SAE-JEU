AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

With frightening speed, you load your shotgun and aim it at the beast !!!!

BOOM 

One shot, but the beast is still coming  towards you!

BOOM

A second shot, the panther starts to limp but continues its relentless march towards you, you hurry to reload your gun to fire one last bulletâ€¦

BOOM
 
You fire one last shot and the beast finally falls off its feet. It is dead, you're alive. What a feat !!!! 

But the danger is far from over. You realise that the confrontation with the panther has attracted the attention of some other creatures on the planet. 

You must make an immediate choice if you want to survive and continue your mission to prepare this world for the arrival of the rest of humanity. 
What do you do?


Choice 1: Gather quickly everything you can from the panther, hoping its skin and organs will be useful, and head for a cave you spotted earlier.


Choice 2: You leave the corpse of the panther behind  to not waste time, and immediately run towards your main shelter, the shuttle hoping not to come across any other predators.
